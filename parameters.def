#
#   Configuration file for the install procedure of the spm2 package.
#
#   The built-in value in the install procedure is shown
#   for each parameter that can be specified in this file,
#   together with the allowed range.
#
#   To introduce your own choice copy to a new line the commented
#   example and modify the value.
#

#
#   Number of points in each line of the frame.
#   Range: 1 ... whatever your computer can handle.
#
# points=100

points=201

#
#   Number of lines in each frame.
#   Range: 0 ... whatever your computer can handle. The value 0 stands
#   for an endless 'chart recorder' scan.
#   
# lines=20

lines=100

#
#   The interval time between two consecutive measurements
#   performed by the ADC (in usec).
#   Range: the interrupt rate (cadence * samples) must be in
#          the range 100 usec ... 2 sec; the adc sampling rate
#          (cadence / adc) must be not less than 5 us.
#
# cadence=200

#
#   Each point in the line contain 'samples' measurements performed
#   by the ADC with the given cadence.
#   Range: depends on the DAQ board characteristics, typically
#          samples*adc <= 2047
#
# samples=1

#
#   Number of ADC channels to be converted at each 'cadence' time interval.
#   Range: typically DAQ boards have one ADC with 1 ... 8 channels multiplexer.
#
# adc=8

#
#   Size of the DAC area. It may be specified smaller than the available
#   number of DAC channels and extra DAC channels will be left unused or
#   written with zeroes. It may also be specified greater than the available
#   number of DAC channels and data in excess used to pass extra
#   information to user space.  
#   Range: whatever is reasonable in the range 0 ... infinity.
#
# dac=8

#
#   Default calibration tables, to be used when actual calibration is
#   not available. They are built according to the pro-forma factor of
#   0.3125 uV / LSB.
#   'adc_cal' is for the master board ADC, 'dac_cal_m' and 'dac_cal_s'
#   are for the master and slave board DAC's respectively.
#   The algorithm is a polynomial interpolation, values in the tables
#   are the polynomial degree followed by the coefficients, constant
#   term first.
#
# adc_cal="3 0 0.000320 0 0"
# dac_cal_m="1 0 3125 0 0"
# dac_cal_s="1 0 3125 0 0"

#
#   Name of the user feedback algorithm, i.e.the name of the (suitable)
#   file put by the user into the spm/feedback directory. If the field
#   is left empty, the install procedure will try in the order:
#   'feedback_code', 'template' and 'simple'  and load the first found.
#   Only template and simple are are in the spm2 packet.
#
# feedback=""

feedback=template

#
#   Use DMA to read data from the ADC, if possible. Usually this option
#   is always on and it is left to the DAQ board driver the choice to use
#   it, if possible.
#   It *must* be on in order to use samples > 1.
#   Range: 0 1
#
# dma=1

#
#   By default, while registering the interrupt handler for the master
#   board, the driver will try to play unfair and request exclusive use
#   of the interrupt line; this is not the common practice with a PCI
#   device, but it can really give an advantage in the interrupt servicing
#   time and in the last this is what we really want from the computer when
#   using this software; if the request fails, it will be repeated for a
#   shared line; with the option "shared=yes", the first request for an
#   exclusive line will be skipped, with "shared=no" the handler registration
#   will fail if exclusive use of the irq line cannot be obtained
#   Range: yes no try
#
# shared=""

#
#   When the system has two identical DAQ boards, the first detected is
#   master, the second slave. With swap=1 the order is reversed.
#
# swap=0

#
#   Statically specify an irq line. Only for diagnostics and problems
#   with the interrupt subsystem.
#
# irq=""

#
#   Statically specify the 'major' device number. For diagnostics and
#   debug only.
#
# major=""
