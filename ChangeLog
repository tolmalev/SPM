2009-12-07  Added 'info' device to read current interrupt routine parameters.

2009-12-02  Modified interrupt overrun threshold in nibac 60 -> 25 usec.

2009-11-27  HOLD_BUFFER in spm_dev.c lets choose buffer allocation policy
            (1: try to reuse / 0: give away asap). Added irq.byte_size.

2009-11-27  Bugs fixed in nobac_init_exit with hrtime_cancel & nibac/install
            with is_master flag.

2009-11-26  Rearranged get_devnumber/release_devnumber to reuse minors when
            unloading/reloading modules.

2009-11-26  Before starting board configuration, niconf takes a lock on scan
            (or fails) to avoid any concurrent operation on irq parameters.

2009-11-25  Update of README.
            New macro's for event buffer handling in user space.

2009-11-20  Major rearrangement of several parts of the code.
	    The 'spm_es' structure, renamed 'spm_global', is now the unique
	    exported symbols and collects all linkages among the several
	    spm2 modules.
	    The event buffer definition has been deeply modified (see
	    include/spm_dev_data.h) and the 'irq_parameters' structure
	    definition, moved to include/spm_bac.h , contains several new
	    fields (sample_adc, sample_dac, adc, dac). 'struct scan_params'
	    modified accordingly.
	    Three new parameters added to the spm_dev module: sample_adc,
	    sample_dac and slot to select the size for adc and dac data area
	    in the event buffer.
	    The registration mechanism for master and slave board driver
	    modified to support variable adc buffer size.
	    Modified the buffer handling mechanism in interrupt context
	    and collected all relevant information for the user feedback
	    code in the single passed argument 'struct irq_parameters * irq'.

2009-11-11  "nobac" can be instructed to generate a stream of accurately
	    timed events (through hrtimers) with given patterns for
	    ADC's data.

2009-11-11  Global symbol spm_es renamed as spm_global.

2009-11-07  Added option -f to "genevent": read from a user file values
	    to be stored into events as ADC's reading.

2009-11-06  A dummy calibration table can be used with boards that do not
	    have a true one (see "parameters.def")

2009-11-06  Added file "parameters.def" with local defaults for spm modules.
	    Values in "parameters.def" override built-in defaults in the
	    "install" procedure (i.e., to reset to native defaults comment
	    out or delete all declarations in "parameters.def") and are
	    overriden by command line parameters to "install".

2009-11-04  nobac can be registered as master and/or slave, in all
	    possible combination with other boards.

2009-09-29  Added in niconf support for "raw data" <--> Volt conversion with
	    N.I. PCI6221 and conversion functions in calibration.c/h.
	    Added use of "raw data" <--> Volt conversion to options in 'frame'.
	    Added test program to read/write ADC/DAC in Volt.

2009-09-16  'nobac' now accepts samples > 1 and (dummy) dma.

2009-07-08  'shift' parameter in feedback/testchans.c to flip DAC 0 between
            values DAC_0 and DAC_0 ^ shift.

2009-06-10  spm_register_feedback_code()/spm_unregister_feedback_code()
            prototypes moved into include/spm_bac.h.

2009-06-08  Added cadence=<usec> to install options and check for
            interrupt cadence sanity.

2009-04-23  Added samples_per_point parameter to perform (under DMA)
            ADC oversampling. DMA supported only for NI6221 board.

2009-04-21  Modified the 'pay_load' area usage. Now it can be large
            whatever size.
            Added the ' ' command to pass parameters once, then arm
            scan many times with 's'.
            Moved the dma area management into nibac_open_release.c
            and added dma, nodma and samples options to the install
            and configuration procedure.

2009-01-30  Added support for DMA with board N.I. PCI-6221; new
	    options in niconf to support DMA configuration, old ones
	    modified.
	    Added default standard variables to spm_fc modules.
	    Now latim_pp/install exits with unambiguous statement when
	    not authorized.
	    Added feedback module "testchans" to twiddle with ADC and
	    DAC values (thanks to G. Aloisi - aloisi@unifi.it).

2009-01-15  Corrected samplePeriodDivisor from cadence_usec in niconf.c

2008-11-20  Now frame accepts values 8 ... 15 to -C option to select DAC
            channels 0 ... 7.

2008-10-24  Moved gnuplot start early in user/latim.c to avoid holding the
            /dev/latim device after latim exits and plot display persists.

2008-10-23  Added to latim_pp module direct log to tty.
            latim_pp recognizes when an external counter cannot be correctly
            read because the parallel port does not accept input mode.

2008-10-14  Replaced .nopage with .fault in vm_operations_struct functions
            in xxbac_mmap.c to comply with kernels > 2.6.26; breaks with
            kernels < 2.6.23.

2008-10-10  DOUBLE_LOG macro in spm_bac.h modified to cope with changes in
            struct tty_struct from kernel 2.6.25 to 2.6.26.

2008-10-10  Install and remove procedure for latim_pp rewritten. Now
            spm/latim_pp/install invoked as an option in spm/install and
            spm/remove cleans all modules.

2008-09-26  genevent.c: added bottom value option: -f option ==> -t , -b

2008-09-26  genevent.c: removed errors in waveform generator
	
2008-09-25  Adjusted log messages in scan_read_write.c

2008-09-22  All error printk in spm/spm_dev/*.c changed to DOUBLE_LOG()
	
2008-09-22  DOUBLE_LOG macro in spm/include/spm_bac.h for diagnostics both to
	    kern.log and current tty.
	
2008-09-22  Better diagnostic messages in spm/install and spm/spm_fc/install.

2008-09-11  Parameter 'algorithm' added to spm_fc module parameters with name
	    of user feedback routine.
